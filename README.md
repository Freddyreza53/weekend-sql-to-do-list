# My Todo List

## Description
Duration: 2 Day Sprint

My Todo List allows the user to input any task along with a date they wish to complete the task by, click the 'add' button to add that task and date to the table below. Once a task is completed, the user can click the green 'COMPLETE' button to change the status of the button from 'In Progress' to 'Task Complete'. There is also a navigation bar at the top of the table with the options 'All', 'In Progress', and 'Complete'. This navigation feature allows the user to show all their tasks when they click on 'All', all in progress tasks when they click on 'In Progress', and all completed tasks when they click on 'Completed'. The user is also able to delete a task before or after they are completed by clicking on the red 'DELETE' button. Another tool the user can use is the 'Search' button. The user can enter a word into the input bar and click on the 'Search' button. The table will update with all the tasks that contain that word. 

A problem I had was trying to incorporate the input date into the search engine.

## Installation

1. Create database named "todo_list"
2. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install.
